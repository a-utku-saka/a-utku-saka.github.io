                <h3>Breast Cancer Stage Detection DSM Application</h3>
                <p class="description">This project involves machine learning models that can predict the stage of breast cancer from clinical data.
                    It is a decision support application for doctors developed using Flask. The project was presented at the
                    MUBAK conference. There is an academic article output.</p>

                <h3>Damage Detection AI</h3>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>-The project prepares a detailed report using the power of artificial intelligence from damaged product images. In this report, it analyzes whether the damage was caused during transportation or for other reasons.</p>
                    <p>-The artificial intelligence model makes suggestions for the seller so that the same problem does not recur again.</p>
                    <p>-Python backend was developed in the project.</p>
                    <p>-A user-friendly interface was developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript where users can select languages and upload images.</p>

                <h3>Exercise Tracking System</h3>
                <p class="description">A program that analyses a person's posture using deep learning and image processing has been developed. By
                    taking data from the camera, it is determined whether the user is doing the exercises correctly. If the
                    movement is done correctly, the counter is increased. Thanks to the guide lines, users can perform movements
                    in the correct position live.</p>

                <h3>AI agent playing Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
                <p class="description">Using reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence agent was developed that plays the game of tic-tac-toe
                    on its own and improves itself by learning various strategies and plays this game with the user.</p>
